Customer segmentation using SQL (RFM model) to identify loyal, at-risk, and churned customers.

Question-01: Analyse Customer Lifecycle Value (CLV) with regards to (RFM Model) Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value

                                    STEP-01:

                SELECT  min(str_to_date(orderdate, '%d/%m/%y')) FROM SALES_DATA;  -- '2020-01-02' 

                                   STEP-02:
